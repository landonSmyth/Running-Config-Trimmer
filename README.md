## Running Configuration Trimmer
---
In my Advanced Networking I and Advanced Networking II courses, we completed group network case studies on Cisco Routers and Switches in the Ontario Tech Networking Lab environment. In these case studies we applied courses concepts and protocols learned through following configuration instructions and guidelines for the lab network. 

Every time we wanted to do a session to work on the case study, we had to paste in running configurations to the devices that we had saved from the previous sessions. Many times in these two projects we spent additional time in our sessions troubleshooting why the paste of the configurations did not properly copy the configurations, or why some commands were skipped, or why the devices accepted or did not accept certain commands. To solve this problem and make the pasting of the configurations easier, I wrote this python program to trim the running configurations after our sessions so that the next time we had to paste in the configurations, it only included the lines we required for our configurations specific to the case study. 

The script makes use of the python `re` module and python file handling to match various default running configuration lines in log files in the same directory as the script and remove those matching lines from the files. Each trimmed running configuration is outputted as the name of the input file followed by `_trimmed.log`. In this repository is an example output from running the script on the `TOR-D1.log` and `Toronto.log` running configurations, the outputted files being `TOR-D1_trimmed.log`, `Toronto.log`, and `Matches.txt`.
